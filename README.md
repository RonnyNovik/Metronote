(Work in progress)</br>
Metronote. is a lightweight, responsive metronome built using the popular ReactJS framework, The focus of this project was to create a clean and simple to use metronome with as little as possible features in order to create a clean and simple experience, I wanted to eliminate any distracting elements and let the musician focus on the beats themselves using a minimal UI and a prominent beat counter.

From a programming standpoint, I have built metronote to practice using timed events and testing which way would produce the most accurate way combined with timed animations, Exploring the limitations setTimeout versus triggered infinite while loops Also it was nice to practice UI design and the WebAudio API a bit, Although i haven't used it's full capabilities.

### Built With
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run metronote locally, you must clone the repository to your machine, you can do this by running the following command in your CLI
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/RonnyNovik/Metronote.git
```

### Installation and running the project locally
This app was boostrapped by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Using metronome is very intuitive, you pick your desired BPM and press on play, simple as that.
You can also change your BPM and this will cause the beat counter to reset.
